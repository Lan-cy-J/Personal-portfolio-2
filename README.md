üöÄ Project Overview
This is a modern, single-page portfolio designed to showcase the skills, award-winning projects, and professional background of Lancy J., a Data Science and Engineering student. The website is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices. It features a clean, minimalist design with interactive elements to create an engaging user experience.

‚ú® Key Features
Fully Responsive Design: The layout fluidly adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile phones to widescreen desktops, using the Bootstrap 5 grid system.

Light/Dark Theme Toggler: Users can switch between a light and a dark theme. The preference is saved in the browser's local storage for a persistent experience.

Smooth Scrolling: Navigation links smoothly animate the scroll to the corresponding sections of the page.

Dynamic Animations: Sections subtly fade and slide into view as the user scrolls, implemented with a lightweight jQuery solution.

Dynamic Content: The copyright year in the footer is automatically updated using JavaScript.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: The site is tested and optimized for all modern web browsers.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
This project was built using a combination of foundational front-end technologies and popular libraries:

HTML5: For the semantic structure and content of the website.

CSS3: For custom styling, branding, and the implementation of the theme-switching logic with CSS variables.

Bootstrap 5: For its powerful, mobile-first responsive grid system and pre-styled components.

jQuery: For DOM manipulation, event handling, and implementing all interactive features.

Google Fonts: For enhanced typography.
